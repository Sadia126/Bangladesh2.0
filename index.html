          Engaging in social business is beneficial to a company because it
          leverages on business competencies to address social issues, involves
          one-time investment with sustainable results, and produces other
          positive effects such as employee motivation and improved
          organizational culture.Peace should be understood in a human way - in
          a broad social, political and economic way. Peace is threatened by
          unjust economic, social and political order, absence of democracy,
          environmental degradation and absence of human rights.
